# TV Script Generation
TV Script Generation (Udacity assigment)

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

Example of script generated with this network:
